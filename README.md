# TestDriveAnything
A War Thunder tool made so that you can test drive any vehicle in the game, now with a graphics interface.

Currently only supports Tank missions.

Note that Ask3ladd's mission and vehicle files are required for this to work.

Tutorial for those files here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbFSo0YqJE0

## Program Guide
1. Install Ask3lad's test drive mission in the correct directories
2. Launch main.exe
3. If you want the program to autmatically replace the old missions, click yes on the first pop-up window and select the directory for War Thunder (example: C:\Program Files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\War Thunder)
4. Choose your Nation and Vehicle and click 'Next'
5. Choose your ammunition loadout and click 'Apply' (for tanks, \<default> is the stock ammuntition for the vehicle)
6. Wait a short while, and done!

If you encounter any errors please post them here on github. As an example, some vehicles may have incorrect calibers in their weapon names, like the PLZ05 - it has a 155mm gun but in game files it is labeled as 152mm and therefore needs a manual override for its caliber.
